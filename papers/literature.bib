@ARTICLE{chekuri2009,

  title = {Dependent Randomized Rounding for Matroid Polytopes and Applications},

  note = {Comment: Rico Zenklusen joined as an author; paper substantially
	expanded compared to previous version; note a slight change in the
	title},
  abstract = {Motivated by several applications, we consider the problem of randomly
	rounding a fractional solution in a matroid (base) polytope to an
	integral one. We consider the pipage rounding technique and also
	present a new technique, randomized swap rounding. Our main technical
	results are concentration bounds for functions of random variables
	arising from these rounding techniques. We prove Chernoff-type concentration
	bounds for linear functions of random variables arising from both
	techniques, and also a lower-tail exponential bound for monotone
	submodular functions of variables arising from randomized swap rounding.
	The following are examples of our applications: (1) We give a (1-1/e-epsilon)-approximation
	algorithm for the problem of maximizing a monotone submodular function
	subject to 1 matroid and k linear constraints, for any constant k
	and epsilon>0. (2) We present a result on minimax packing problems
	that involve a matroid base constraint. We give an O(log m / log
	log m)-approximation for the general problem Min {lambda: x \in {0,1}^N,
	x \in B(M), Ax <= lambda b}, where m is the number of packing constraints.
	(3) We generalize the continuous greedy algorithm to problems involving
	multiple submodular functions, and use it to find a (1-1/e-epsilon)-approximate
	pareto set for the problem of maximizing a constant number of monotone
	submodular functions subject to a matroid constraint. An example
	is the Submodular Welfare Problem where we are looking for an approximate
	pareto set with respect to individual players' utilities.},
